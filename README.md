# FootballPredictor


This was my first machine learning project with Python, and my introduction to the wonderful world of Jupyter notebooks! An overly ambitious atempt to get rich quick and although I knew deep down it would never work it was very fun.

The data from football-data.co.uk was a good baseline to generate some interesting features, but it was never going to be enough to generate any meaningful results from.
